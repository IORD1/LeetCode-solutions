You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [90], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

sol:
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int diff = nums[k-1]-nums[0];
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size()-k+1; i++){
            int local = nums[i+k-1]-nums[i];
            // cout<<nums[i]<<"-"<<nums[i+k-1]<<endl;
            diff = min(diff,local);
        }
        return diff;
    }
};
